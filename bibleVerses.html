      <h2 class="bible">10/10/2020: Waiting Forwardly</h2>
      <p class="verse">The day of the Lord will come like a thief. The skies will disappear with a loud noise…So what kind of people should you be?</p>
      <p class="bible-2">2 Peter 3:10-11</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="explantion">Great question. What kind of people should we be? Peter tells us: "You should live holy lives and serve God, as you wait for and look forward to the second coming.
      </p>

      <p class="explantion">
        Hope of the future is not a license for irresponsibility in the present. Let us wait forwardly, but let us wait.</p>
      <p class="explantion">
        But for most of us, waiting is not our problem. Or, maybe I should state, waiting is our problem. We are so good at waiting that we don’t wait forwardly. We forget to look. We are too content. We seldom search the skies. We seldom, if ever, allow the Holy Spirt to interrupt our plans and lead us to worship so that we might see Jesus.

        <h2 class="bible">10/9/2020: A Home For Your Heart</h2>
        <p class="verse">For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. </p>
        <p class="bible-2">Jeremiah 29:11</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="explantion">Chances are you've given little thought to housing. We create elaborate housing for our bodies, but our souls are relegated to a hillside shanty where the night winds chill us and the rain soaks us. Is it any wonder the world is so full of cold hearts?</p>

        <p class="explantion">
          It doesn’t have to be this way. We don’t have to live outside. It's not God's plan for your heart to roam as a Bedouin. God wants you to move in out of the cold and live with him. Under his roof there is space available. At his table a plate is set for you. In his living room there is a chair reserved for you. And he would like you to take up residence in his house. Why would he want you to share his home? Simply because he's your father. </p>

      <h2 class="bible">10/7/2020: Time Slips By</h2>
      <p class="verse">For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. </p>
      <p class="bible-2">Jeremiah 29:11</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="explantion">As we get older, our vision should improve. Not our vision of earth, but our vision of heaven. Those who have spent their life looking for heaven gain a skip in their step as the city comes into view. Time slips. Days pass. Years fade. Life ends. And what we came to do must be done while there is time </p>

    <h2 class="bible">10/6/2020:</h2>
    <p class="verse">For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<h3 class="topic">2. The Departure of Saint Paul of the Danfeek Mount</h3>
<p id="paragraph">One this day also, the Holy Father Paul, the monk in Danfeek Mountain, departed. This saint was born in the village of Danfeek and his father was a farmer, who taught hime the profession of carpentry.</p>
<p id="paragraph">
  When he grew he longed for the monastic life. He forsook the world and that therein and went to mount Danfeek which is nearby his hometown. There he became a monk and a disciple to one of the elders of the mount.
</p>
<p id="paragraph">
He was simple and pure in heart therefore he was ordained a priest and was appointed to take care of the brethern. He excelled in leading them with the fear of God guiding them in the way of godliness and asceticism. He had reached a high level of holiness and was taken up to heaven. He saw hidden mysteries and the angels praising God.
</p>
<p id="paragraph">
  When the Lord willed to repose him to the the place of eternal rest, he gathered the monks and commanded them to keep the monastic rules then departed in peace. The monks buried him with great veneration.
</p>
<p id="paragraph">
  The blessing of his prayers be with us all and glory be to our God forever. Amen
